__Endowing rotation invariance for 3D finger shape and vein verification__

## Abstract
Finger vein biometrics have been extensively studied for the capability to detect aliveness, and the high security as intrinsic traits. However, vein pattern distortion caused by finger rotation degrades the performance of CNN in 2D finger vein recognition, especially in a contactless mode. To address the finger posture variation problem, we propose a 3D finger vein verification system extracting axial rotation invariant feature. An efficient 3D finger vein reconstruction optimization model is proposed and several accelerating strategies are adopted to achieve real-time 3D reconstruction on an embedded platform. The main contribution in this paper is that we are the first to propose a novel 3D point-cloud-based end-to-end neural network to extract deep axial rotation invariant feature, namely 3DFVSNet. In the network, the rotation problem is transformed to a permutation problem with the help of specially designed rotation groups. Finally, to validate the performance of the proposed network more rigorously and enrich the database resources for the finger vein recognition community, we built the largest publicly available 3D finger vein dataset with different degrees of finger rotation, namely the **Large-scale Finger Multi-Biometric Database-3D Pose Varied Finger Vein (SCUT LFMB-3DPVFV) Dataset**. Experimental results on 3D finger vein datasets show that our 3DFVSNet holds strong robustness against axial rotation compared to other approaches.

## SCUT LFMB-3DPVFV Dataset
**Large-scale Finger Multi-Biometric Database-3D Pose Varied Finger Vein (SCUT LFMB-3DPVFV) Dataset**

We introduce a 3D finger vein dataset--__the Large-scale Finger Multi-Biometric Database-3DPose Varied Finger Vein (SCUT LFMB-3DPVFV) Dataset__.
__SCUT LFMB-3DPVFV__ contains 702 fingers collected from the index finger and middle finger of both right and left hands. Each finger was acquired 14 times and the 3D model was reconstructed from images from 3 different views. To simulate the arbitrary rotation in realistic scenarios, the volunteers are asked to rotate their fingers in various poses. The first 10 acquisitions are collected with rotation no more than ±30 degrees, while the remaining 4 times are collected by rotating the fingers with larger rotation no more than ±80 degrees. Finally, There are 7020 3D finger vein models for easy rotation and 9828 3D finger vein models for hard rotation.
